# devstore

This application is a simple shirt store made with Next.js (App Router).<br>
In this project, I learned how to build a Next App using App Router and several concepts like Server Components, Client Components, how data is fetched in components, memoization, cache, loading pages, etc.<br>
I also used Cypress to do end-to-end tests and created a workflow to do CI in github, running all the tests when a new push is made to the repo.<br>
